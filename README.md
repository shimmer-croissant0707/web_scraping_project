# NYCDSA Web Scraping Project

This is a web scraping project where I scraped the website xiachufang using Scrapy package. 

I mainly studied the following questions.

-How would the exclusive, picture steps, master cook and authors influence the ratings, number of attempts for the recipe and the number of ingredients used in the recipe?
-What are the popularities for each major ingredients?
Pork, chicken, beef, lamb, fish, shrimp, egg, tofu
-How would the number of ingredients affect the ratings and number of attempts for the recipe?
-What are the more common combinations of ingredients?

Possible future work could be the followings.
Statistical analysis of exclusiveness, picture steps and master cooks.
Try to perform a more detailed classification of the ingredients.
If possible, scrape another similar website and see if certain conclusions about common combinations hold as well.
